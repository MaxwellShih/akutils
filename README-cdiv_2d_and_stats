I wrote this for me to save time during QIIME workflows.
You need a biom table to process wth a mapping file that
contains at least one category.  Drop the script into your
path and call it from command line.  It will ask for
input:

cdiv_2d_and_stats.sh

It will produce:
1) core_diversity_analyses.py workflow.
2) anosim and permanova stats for all categories you specify,
collated in a text file in your output folder.
3) 2d plots, like the old QIIME used to do.  Easier to look
at and plop into a presentation or paper than the 3d ones.
No one will whine about a black background either...

It parallelizes core diversity which will use the number
of cores you specify in normal behavior for that script.
It also parallelizes the stats and 2d plots which can swamp
a less-capable computer for a little while.  Just be patient.

There is a matplotlib error thrown while the 2d plots are
produced.
I don't really understand python yet.  I tried making a
change to the rcParams file, but it doesn't seem to have
any effect.  So ignore this pointless error message...
