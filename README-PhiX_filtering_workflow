This script will take raw fastq data from a MiSeq run with single
indexing, strip PhiX reads, and join your data together.  You will
be provided with joined fastqs for both the filtered and unfiltered
data.  You will also be provided with accurate quantities of reads
that are either PhiX or your data.  This may be useful for
estimation of mixed cluster rates and therefore to provide a
meaningful level of filtering on a per-experiment basis.  Keep in
mind that excess filtering will increase your type II error rate
(false negatives) while underfiltering increases type I rates
(false positives).

Note: I have been communicating with Illumina about phix
contamination and we agree the phix reads are not likley 
indicative of sample-sample bleed over, though it is still
probably evidence that it happens, but at a lower rate than
phix infiltration.

Running this script assumes you have already done the following:

1) Installed and have a functioning ea-utils in your path as this
workflow calls both fastq-multx and fastq-join.

https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/

You should cite ea-utils for being such a kick-ass utility:

Erik Aronesty (2011). ea-utils : "Command-line tools for processing biological sequencing data"; http://code.google.com/p/ea-utils

2) Installed and have a functioning fastx-toolkit in your path as
this workflow calls fastx_trimmer.

http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/

I'm not certain if/how to cite this excellent package except as a
website (as of 12/26/14).

3) Installed and have a functioning smalt in your path as this is
the utility used for searching your data for PhiX174 contamination.

https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/

4) Run smalt to generate an index of the PhiX genome for searching
during this workflow.  Use this command:

smalt index -k 11 -s 1 phix-k11-s1 <sourcefasta>

Download the reference sequence for PhiX used during Illumina
sequencing here (dowload as fasta):

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/NC_001422

5) Have a barcodes file that fastq-multx will accept.  See the
ea-utils website for more and better documentation, but below is a
small sample.  File contains no headers, but headers are provided
here for illustrative purposes.

Index sequences must be in the CORRECT ORIENTATION!!  If you have
a QIIME mapping file with reverse complemented indexes (you have
to pass --rev_comp_mapping_barcodes during demultiplexing), you can
copy all the sequences from a column if you open your map in Excel
or Libre, and paste it into the below website and it will return
all sequences in columnar format which you can paste into another
sheet containing your sample names and category columns.

UniqueSampleName	IndexSequence	Category
sample1	ACGTTCTAGGCT	experiment
sample2	CGGGATTCTATT	experiment
sample3	TTCGGATTCTAC	experiment
sample4	GACTTAGCCTAT	experiment

6) Have a functioning version of QIIME installed and working for you.
Not a small task, but if you are reading this far into this
particular document, you probably already know what you are doing.
This workflow calls the filter_fasta.py command for stripping
PhiX reads from your data.

Happy PhiX filtering!!
