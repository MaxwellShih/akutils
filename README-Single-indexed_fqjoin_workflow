This is a workflow script meant to simplify joining of PE sequencing
data from Illumina instruments.  You need to have ea-utils installed:

https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/

And cite ea-utils if you use this:

Erik Aronesty (2011). ea-utils : "Command-line tools for processing biological sequencing data"; http://code.google.com/p/ea-utils
Erik Aronesty (2013). TOBioiJ : "Comparison of Sequencing Utility Programs", DOI:10.2174/1875036201307010001

As well, you need to have fastx_toolkit installed:

http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/

Place this script somewhere in your path and call it from within 
the folder that contains your raw sequence data (fastq format).

Make sure to set it to be executable

chmod a+x Single_indexed_joining_workflow.sh

I wrote this for me, and I use a MiSeq.  If you have hiseq data you 
may need to change the fastx_trimmer commands to allow for a
different quality score encoding.  Miseq uses phred33 so the
"-Q 33" part is needed to correctly interpret the data.  Hiseqs I
think might be using phred64 now (change to -Q 64) but this may be
dependent on the software your provider is using.

This script definitely works on Ubuntu 14.04 with ea-utils and fastx_toolkit
installed.  If you have something else and this isn't working, I    
cannot help!!
